# fractional-occurrence
 Notebooks related to a trend in the occurrence of Kepler's small, close-in planets.
 ```
 This page is a work in progress! So far, I've uploaded notebooks to:
 - fit a PLDF to the Kepler data and the trend in fractional occurrence.
 Notebooks to explore the fit results coming soon!
 ```
 Requirements
 ---
 To reevaluate the Kepler survey completeness in bins of stellar mass, these notebooks require the  ``custom-completeness`` tool available [here](https://github.com/gbergsten/custom-completeness). The two codes should work together if both folders are in the same directory.
